# 🚗 Driver Drowsiness Detection System
Machine Learning + Feature Engineering + Real-World Simulation
📌 Project Overview

Driver drowsiness is one of the major causes of road accidents worldwide.
This project builds a machine learning–based early warning system that predicts whether a driver is Alert or Drowsy using:

Physiological signals (Heart Rate, Alertness Level, Fatigue)

Driving behavior (Speed, Speed Variability)

Environmental factors (Random Weather Simulation)

Feature Engineering + ML Pipelines + XGBoost

This repository contains the complete end-to-end ML workflow, from data generation → preprocessing → feature engineering → model training → optimization → evaluation → deployment setup.

📊 Dataset Explanation

The dataset is synthetically generated but follows real-world medical and behavioral logic.

Drowsiness Probability Formula
drowsy_prob = (
    0.35*(1-df['Alertness'])+
    0.30*(df['Fatigue'])+
    0.10*(df['HR']>105).astype(int)+
    0.05*(df['HR']<55).astype(int)+
    0.08*(df['Speed']<50).astype(int)+
    0.07*(df['speed_change']<8).astype(int)+
    0.05*((df['prev_alertness']-df['Alertness'])>0.2).astype(int)
)     


This ensures:

Low alertness → strong drowsy signal

High fatigue → strong drowsy signal

High HR → stress or early fatigue

Slow speed → common sleepy behavior

This makes the dataset highly learnable for ML models.
